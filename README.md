# Advanced Skyblocks

Bringing a more Minecraft like version of skyblocks to Minetest.

# Modpack details

## Included

> Found in this modpack

* Island (adv_sb_island)
* Ore generator (adv_sb_oregen)

## Required

* [Protector Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/protector/) (TenPlus1)
* Either default or mcl_core

## Features

* Attempt at full gameplay experience (for either Minetest Game or one of the Mineclone forks)
* Protection of islands (Using Protectors to provide simple protection of nodes and chests)
* Traditional skyblocks experience (no shops, minimal trading, and you have to build a bridge to someones island to visit them)

# Setup

* **Must** use `singlenode` map generation (the map needs to be empty).
* Start your server, then stop it. (This will pregenerate in your `minetest.conf` settings you might want to edit/change, don't change these once players have joined) \*
* Edit your config
* Start your server and enjoy.

\* Or you could just look at `settingtypes.txt` in adv_sb_island for the island settings you might want to change/add to your `minetest.conf` settings file. (Want to also customize the ore generator, just look at `settingtypes.txt` in adv_sb_oregen)

> If you want/need to change your settings after players have joined, unfortuately you will have to reset your map (i.e. blow away `map.sqlite` and start all over with a new map)

## Mods that could make gameplay more interesting

> This modpack simply allows a base of skyblocks experience, you can choose what you want.

* [Currency](https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/currency/) (VanessaE) This mod would be good to have for those players who play and manufacture items (i.e. adds bartering and shops, but only player built, unless you built a player who sells/buys everything who is a admin)
* [Icyessentials](https://gitlab.icynet.eu/evert/icyessentials) (IcyDiamond) This mod adds warps/kits and more for a more OP Skyblocks like feel (i.e. Maybe you built a admin shop but want to set a warp so players can access shop on demand)
* [Mobs Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/) (TenPlus1) This mod along with say [Mobs Animal](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs_animal/), and [Mobs Monster](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs_monster/) could make your Skyblocks server dangerous (This is only needed if in Minetest Game, Mineclone comes with monsters and animals built-in to Mineclone)
